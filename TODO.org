* Tasks for ILGE2010
** DONE Try to get things working under CCL again
   I guess it was fine... need to load the system twice, though :(
** DONE Write TCP server
** TODO Characters 08/07
*** TODO Add character creation.
*** TODO Add logging into characters associated with accounts.
** TODO Parse user input 08/07
*** TODO Parse a very simple grammar
    Maybe something like <verb [direct-object] [indirect-object]["chat string"]> is enough for now.
*** TODO Add some basic social verbs (chat string only)
*** TODO Write binder to associate commands with in-game objects
    Need in-game objects for this!
*** TODO Improve existing verbs to use binder (for targeting!)
*** TODO Add some verbs with complex, multi-step interactions (using tasks?)
*** TODO Add adjective support
*** TODO Add possessives support
*** TODO Add adverb support
** TODO Game world 08/08
*** TODO Create a few rooms.
*** TODO Allow characters to be inside a room.
*** TODO Port messaging functions to broadcast to _rooms_.
*** TODO Add movement between rooms.
*** TODO Allow rooms to act as containers (having other objects in them)
*** TODO Add features to objects (details)
** TODO Persist the world 08/08
*** DONE Make accounts persistent
    These are probably good candidates to get started with -- maybe rucksack can actually work. Note
    that using rucksack means pretty much throwing CCL support out the window for now.  Another
    alternative might be to persist things to CouchDB, which might be relatively
    easy. Unfortunately, there's no library to directly do this from lisp objects (and I won't write
    one).
    UPDATE: Hooray! Accounts are now persistent. It's slow as balls, but it's good enough for ilge.
*** TODO Make game objects persistent
** TODO Port tasks 08/08
   Tasks will probably have to be ported relatively early, since they're the only way to schedule
   something for later.
** TODO Combat 08/08
*** TODO Add basic combat verbs without any extra actions.
*** TODO Add basic AC-based combat rolls to combat verbs
*** TODO Add defense poses (block, brace, dodge, accept)
*** TODO Configure some combat-verbs so they're affected by adverbs
** TODO Make TCP server more robust 08/09
*** TODO Fix read-line-from-client
**** DONE Make it not error!
**** TODO Handle code->char conversion properly.
     What is 'properly'? What do I have to take into account?
**** TODO Implement a ring buffer to chunk input.
*** TODO Set up a proper logging system
*** TODO Stress-test TCP server
    Write a basic thing that can spawn several hundred clients and hammer the server with input.
** TODO Accounts 08/09
*** DONE Account creation
*** DONE Log into account
*** TODO Validate input - 08/09
    There's no validation of username/password/emails during account creation. Ew.
** TODO Launch! 08/10
   Invite people and have some duels!
* Post-ILGE
** TODO Port clock
   For CPU limiting! This is an easy task. Nice for when stuck. Not necessary for launch, though.
** TODO Add fancier telnet support
*** TODO readline-ish input
*** TODO Colors!
** TODO Web-based interface
*** TODO Generic service provider protocol
*** TODO hunchentoot-based service provider
*** TODO AJAX web client
**** TODO Draw an interface on a web page.
**** TODO Ask server for a hello-world line.
**** TODO Send server a hello-world line.
**** TODO Send and receive raw text messages to/from server.
**** TODO Convert text messaging to JSON-based messages.
**** TODO Start sending and receiving JSON messages with extra info in them.
***** TODO Send the server's current time.
***** TODO Add a 'look' packet that will display look information on a side pane.
***** TODO Convert the plain-text message strings to complex JSON with identifiers for objects.
***** TODO Make all identified objects render as links to a 'look' in the interface.
**** TODO Add an inventory-management GUI
*** TODO Login screen
    Code monkey think maybe manager wanna write goddamn login page himself.
** TODO Write a Marrach-like tech demo game.
   Relatively small area, full description, some basic systems in place! (no crafting or stuff, though)
** TODO Super-awesome building system
*** TODO Write a VM!
*** TODO Write a custom prototype-based lisp to run on the VM!
*** TODO Make it SUPER-PERSISTENT!
*** TODO Shit double rainbows!
    By the time this actually works, I will!
