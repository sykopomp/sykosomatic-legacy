* Tasks for ILGE2010
** DONE Try to get things working under CCL again
   I guess it was fine... need to load the system twice, though :(
** DONE Write TCP server
** TODO Make TCP server more robust
*** TODO Fix read-line-from-client
**** DONE Make it not error!
**** TODO Handle code->char conversion properly.
     What is 'properly'? What do I have to take into account?
**** TODO Implement a ring buffer to chunk input.
*** TODO Set up a proper logging system
*** TODO Stress-test TCP server
    Write a basic thing that can spawn several hundred clients and hammer the server with input.
** DONE Accounts
*** DONE Account creation
*** DONE Log into account
** TODO Set up persistence
*** DONE Make accounts persistent
    These are probably good candidates to get started with -- maybe rucksack can actually work. Note
    that using rucksack means pretty much throwing CCL support out the window for now.  Another
    alternative might be to persist things to CouchDB, which might be relatively
    easy. Unfortunately, there's no library to directly do this from lisp objects (and I won't write
    one).
    UPDATE: Hooray! Accounts are now persistent. It's slow as balls, but it's good enough for ilge.

*** TODO Write a VM!
*** TODO Write a custom prototype-based lisp to run on the VM!
*** TODO Make it SUPER-PERSISTENT!
*** TODO Shit double rainbows!
    By the time this actually works, I will!
