REQUIREMENTS
------------

* cl-store (http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-store/)
* cl-ppcre (http://weitz.de/cl-ppcre/)
* Probably SBCL. I haven't tested this on any other implementation.

INSTALLATION
------------

1. Get all the required source code
   A. With asdf-install:
      *CL-USER> (asdf-install:install :cl-store)
      *CL-USER> (asdf-install:install :cl-ppcre)
   B. Manually
      * download http://weitz.de/files/cl-ppcre.tar.gz
       		http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-store/files/cl-store-latest.tgz
      * extract to ~/.sbcl/site/ (or whereven you put your sources)
      * expose relevant .asd files to Lisp.
   
	See http://www.cliki.net/asdf for generic information on how to use
	ASDF.
	Basically, create symlinks to cl-store.asd and cl-ppcre.asd
	inside your systems folder for your lisp (like
	~/.sbcl/systems/)

2. Load up sykosomatic.
   A. In Slime with SBCL:
      * (require 'sykosomatic)
      * Hope for the best!
   B. In anything else:
      *something like (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op 'sykosomatic)
      * Hope for the best even more.

3. Get yourself into the package.
   * (in-package sykosomatic)

4. ???

5. Happy Hacking!
