REQUIREMENTS
------------

* cl-store (http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-store/)
* cl-ppcre (http://weitz.de/cl-ppcre/)
* cl-cont (http://common-lisp.net/project/cl-cont/)
* bordeaux-threads (http://common-lisp.net/project/bordeaux-threads/)
* usocket (http://common-lisp.net/project/usocket/)
* SBCL, no other lisp is supported right now. 


INSTALLATION
------------

1. Get all the required source code
   A. With asdf-install:
      *CL-USER> (asdf-install:install :cl-store)
      *CL-USER> (asdf-install:install :cl-ppcre)
      *etc..

   B. Manually
      * download the tarballs for each dependency.
      * extract to ~/.sbcl/site/ (or whereven you put your sources)
      * expose relevant .asd files to Lisp.
   
	See http://www.cliki.net/asdf for generic information on how to use
	ASDF.
	Basically, create symlinks to the .asd files for each dep.
	inside your systems folder for your lisp (like ~/.sbcl/systems/)

2. Load up sykosomatic.
   A. In Slime with SBCL:
      * (require 'sykosomatic)
      * Hope for the best!
   B. In anything else:
      *something like (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op 'sykosomatic)
      * Hope for the best even more.

3. Get yourself into the package.
   * (in-package sykosomatic)

4. ???

5. Happy Hacking!

TESTING THE SERVER
------------------
The server runs on port 4000 by default, and will accept external connections by
default. If you want to prevent those, start the server with :address "127.0.0.1".

Telnet clients can connect with 'telnet <address> <port>', and the engine can currently
handle all the garbage telnet likes sending (I think).
Read through client.lisp to see what you can do to the poor victims.

Logs are all tossed into ~/.sykosomatic/logs/sykosomatic.log right now. 

Oh, and if you want to change any directories, read through config.lisp. You can set the
base game directory there.
